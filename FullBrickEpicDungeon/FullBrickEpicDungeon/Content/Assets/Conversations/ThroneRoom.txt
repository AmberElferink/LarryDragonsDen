Hi, this is a test
Dragon: Welcome to my humble castle. Would you like a cup of tea?
#1. Tea tastes like bird poop. I am sick of tea!
#2. Well you could say that this is turning into a horrible par-tea.
#3. Why the sudden hospitali-tea?
Dragon: Sick of tea???? That is like being sick of breathing.
Dragon: That was a horrible joke.
Dragon: I am a gentleman of refined taste.
Dragon: No tea then. You seem familiar. Have I met you before?
#1. We met when Larry, our trusty mount, sat on his favourite toilet seat.
#2. Only in my dreams. It involved some serious crap with Larry.
#3. Your hat seems somewhat familiar... Is that Larrys birdshit on it?
Dragon: ... 
Dragon: I think I get the drift.
Dragon: Oh no, is that still on it? I hate Larry, that unsanitary canary!
Dragon: So where is your epic mount now huh?
#1. Your mom is my epic mount
#2. I have no clue. Do I look like mount cleverest?
#3. You stupid? You captured him!
Dragon: How dare you say something about my beautiful mother?
Dragon: No you definitely do not look like that name would suit you
Dragon: Now you are just being rude!
Dragon: Goodbye!
