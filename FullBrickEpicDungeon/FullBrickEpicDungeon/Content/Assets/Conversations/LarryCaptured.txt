The Dragon on his turn thinks:
'Well what do I see?'
It not only stinks,
This looks more horrible than graffiti
The dragon, upset: "This is very rude!"
"I will cage you up for that crime, feather head, nude!"
The heroes, deprived of their beloved bird,
Decided at once, with not even a word,
Faced with a jump of a few hundred feet,
That with the dragon they would have to meet.
Up they climbed, to the dragon's window,
All at the ready, to strike many a blow.
