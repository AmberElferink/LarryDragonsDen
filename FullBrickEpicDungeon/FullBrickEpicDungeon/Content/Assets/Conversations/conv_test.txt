Hi, this is a test
Dragon: Welcome to my humble castle. Would you like a cup of tea?
#Choice 1 Tea tastes like bird poop. I am sick of tea!
#Choice 2 Well you could say that this is turning into a horrible par-tea.
#Choice 3 Why the sudden hospitali-tea?
Dragon: Sick of tea???? That is like being sick of breathing.
Dragon: That was a horrible joke.
Dragon: I am a gentleman of refined taste.
Dragon: No tea then. You seem familiar. Have I met you before?
#Choice 1 We met when Larry, our trusty mount, sat on his favourite toilet seat.
#Choice 2 Only in my dreams. It involved some serious crap with Larry.
#Choice 3 Your hat seems somewhat familiar... Is that Larrys birdshit on it?
Dragon: ... 
Dragon: I think I get the drift.
Dragon: Oh no, is that still on it? I hate Larry, that unsanitary canary!
Dragon: So where is your epic mount now huh?
#Choice 1 Your mom is my epic mount
#Choice 2 I have no clue. Do I look like mount cleverest?
#Choice 3 You stupid? You captured him!
Dragon: How dare you say something about my beautiful mother?
Dragon: No you definitely do not look like that name would suit you
Dragon: Now you are just being rude!
Dragon: Goodbye!
